## Category Mapping Note

The category numbers in `locomo10.json` do NOT match the paper's text ordering.
See `config/category_mapping.json` for the correct mapping (source: official repo Issue #27).

Supermemory/MemoryBench uses text labels (e.g., "world-knowledge") that correctly align with Issue #27's mapping.
